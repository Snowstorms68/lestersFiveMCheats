<h3>What makes the refund not possible</h3>
<h4>A refund is not possible for the following reasons. Due to the fact that you get complete access to the code of the script after a purchase, we can unfortunately not offer you a refund, you could keep the file and we can not track whether you delete the file or vllt have saved it somewhere else or have uploaded it, so it is not possible to request a refund. </h4>

<p>
We only accept private payments, which means only payments via direct transfer and in exceptional cases gift cards are also possible, we do not accept payments via PayPal Buyer Protection or other Buyer Protection payments, if you accidentally pay via Buyer Protection we do NOT accept the fees that arise due to your error, in any case the buyer pays the payment fees.

<h3>Why No Buyer Protection Is Accepted</h3>
<h4>We cannot accept buyer protection because you have the possibility to withdraw your money through the buyer protection, because we send you our product digitally we can not give a transmission number and would lose any conflict with PayPal etc. </h4>
